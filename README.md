**Note**: Most of configs in this extension are not working anymore due to Google page layout changes. Some features are now implemented by Google itself, such as favicons.

Customize the looks and behavior of Google search page for better productivity

* Make whole search result clickable and interactive (just like in DuckDuckGo)
* Make search results look and behave like cards, with configurable border radius, shadows, colors and so on
* Add website favicons to search results 
* Extended keyboard navigation with arrow keys and number keys
* Move actual search results on top of page, so you'll never have to scroll all way down to find them
* Utilize horizontal screen space and scroll less by moving search widgets to the right sidebar, basically getting 2-column view
